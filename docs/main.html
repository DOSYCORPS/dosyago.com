    The products we're developing currently fall into two categories:
  <dl>
    <dt>Products
    <dd>Public
    <dd>Secret
  </dl>
  <p>
    By <dfn>public</dfn> products we mean those we can tell you about right now, even as they're still being developed.
  <p>
    By <dfn>secret</dfn> we mean those we don't want to mention about, yet we're really excited to be working on them.
  <h1>Public Products</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href=#litewait></a>
      &mdash;

  <p>
    Litewait (at <a href=https://litewait.io>litewait.io</a>) is a web browser that saves you data and bandwidth costs, 
    by reducing the amount of CSS, HTML and JavaScript sent to you, while still delivering you the content and functions,
    of the pages you visit.
  <p>
    We built litewait to save ourselves money when traveling and buying 4G data sims, because sometimes it's hard to unlimited data for a good price. Another bonus is our phone runs less hot (because less code means less battery used) and so we can browser for longer. A downside is you don't get any images, fancy looking design, videos, or other things. And the sites can look a bit different to what you're used to. 
  <p>
    Maybe the downsides will mean that people will not find litewait useful. But we think that in the cases where you need access to the web regularly but that access is too expensive, or the connection is to slow, to use a regular browser, litewait is a useful option.
