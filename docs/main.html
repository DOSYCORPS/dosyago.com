    The products we're developing currently fall into two categories:
  <dl>
    <dt>Products
    <dd>Public
    <dd>Secret
  </dl>
  <p>
    By <dfn>public</dfn> products we mean those we can tell you about right now, even as they're still being developed.
  <p>
    By <dfn>secret</dfn> we mean those we don't want to mention about, yet we're really excited to be working on them.
  <h1>Public Products</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href=#litewait></a>

  <p>
    Litewait (at <a href=https://litewait.io>litewait.io</a>) is a web browser that saves you data and bandwidth costs.
  <p>
    We built it for using the web while travelling.
  <p>
    It cuts out lots of stuff like videos and images, so maybe you won't like it.
  <p>
    Use it if you want to save money and bandwidth.
