    By <dfn>secret</dfn> we mean those we don't want to mention about, yet we're really excited to be working on them.

    Litewait (at <a href=https://litewait.io>litewait.io</a>) is a web browser that saves you data and bandwidth costs.
  <p>
    We built it for using the web while travelling.
  <p>
    It cuts out lots of stuff like videos and images, so maybe you won't like it.
  <p>
    Use it if you want to save money and bandwidth.
